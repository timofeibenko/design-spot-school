# DesignSpotSchool

You can watch the site live [here](https://timofei-benko.github.io/design-spot-school/).

This project was made based on a figma mockup that was given to me by my mentor at TeachMeSkills where I studied 
front-end 
development. I have finally 
found some time to finish and publish it.

The design itself was really dysfunctional at certain places and generally had a lot of dubious decisions in terms of 
UI/UX, 
some of 
which I decided not to follow. But at 
most, my work sticks to the original. 

Mobile layout was conceptualized by me, the original had only the tablet and desktop.

* The site uses Swiper for sliders
* The accordion is done with just CSS and vanilla JS
* There's still a burger menu to be finished
* The project bundles via 
Webpack
